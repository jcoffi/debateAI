# AI API Specifications: August 2025

**The major AI providers have converged on million-token context windows while diverging in specialized capabilities: OpenAI leads in coding and agents, Google offers the best price-performance ratio, and Anthropic excels at complex reasoning tasks.** All three providers have released significant updates in 2025, with OpenAI launching GPT-5, Google introducing thinking-capable Flash models, and Anthropic releasing Claude 4 with extended reasoning. This comprehensive comparison covers production-ready models available via API as of August 2025, excluding preview or limited-access offerings.

## Model names and flagship offerings

The landscape of available models has expanded significantly, with each provider offering distinct tiers optimized for different use cases. **OpenAI's GPT-5 series** represents their latest flagship, specifically tuned for coding and agentic workflows with three variants (standard, mini, nano) offering different price-performance trade-offs. The naming convention follows `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano` for API calls. Their GPT-4.1 series, released in April 2025, brings **1 million token context windows** across all variants while maintaining cost efficiency.

Google's Gemini 2.5 series leads their offering with `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` as the primary production models. These models uniquely feature **"thinking capabilities"** that show reasoning processes, a feature previously exclusive to specialized reasoning models. The Gemini 2.0 series (`gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`) remains available for applications prioritizing speed and cost over advanced reasoning.

Anthropic's Claude 4 family includes `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` as the flagship, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for balanced performance, and the fast `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`. Unlike competitors who use simple version numbers, **Anthropic requires specific date-stamped model identifiers** for production use, ensuring version stability but requiring more careful tracking of model updates.

## Pricing structures reveal strategic positioning

The pricing landscape shows clear differentiation strategies among providers. OpenAI's GPT-5 costs **$1.25 per million input tokens and $10.00 per million output tokens**, positioning it as a premium offering justified by its **74.9% score on SWE-bench Verified** for coding tasks. Their most economical option, GPT-5 nano, runs at just $0.05/$0.40 per million tokens, making it competitive for high-volume applications.

Google aggressively prices Gemini 2.5 Flash at **$0.30 input and $2.50 output per million tokens**, offering arguably the best price-performance ratio in the market. Their Flash-Lite variant drops even lower to $0.10/$0.40 per million tokens. **Batch processing provides a 50% discount** across all Gemini models, making them particularly attractive for non-real-time workloads. Google uniquely charges different rates for audio input ($1.00 per million tokens for Flash) versus text/image/video.

Anthropic maintains premium pricing for their Opus models at $15/$75 per million tokens, but their Haiku 3.5 at **$0.80/$4.00 per million tokens** provides a competitive fast option. Their prompt caching system offers significant savings with cache hits costing only 10% of base input prices, rewarding applications that reuse context frequently.

## Context windows reach unprecedented scales

All three providers now offer models with context windows exceeding 1 million tokens, though implementation details vary significantly. **Google leads with all Gemini 2.5 models supporting 1,048,576 input tokens** as standard, with output limits of 65,536 tokens. This massive context enables processing entire codebases, lengthy documents, or hours of audio/video content in a single request.

OpenAI's GPT-4.1 series matches Google's 1 million token input capacity while their GPT-5 series offers a more modest but still substantial 272,000 input tokens with 128,000 output tokens. The reasoning models (o3, o4-mini) provide 200,000 token contexts, with the unique consideration that **"invisible reasoning tokens" count toward output limits**, potentially consuming significant capacity during complex problem-solving.

Anthropic standardizes on 200,000 tokens across all models, though **Claude Sonnet 4 offers beta access to 1 million token contexts** with the `context-1m-2025-08-07` header. Their Claude Sonnet 3.7 uniquely supports up to 128,000 output tokens with beta headers, exceeding most competitors' output capabilities.

## Specialized capabilities define use case alignment

Each provider has developed distinct strengths that guide model selection. OpenAI's GPT-5 series excels at **complex tool chaining and parallel execution**, making it ideal for autonomous agents that need to coordinate multiple functions. Their o4-mini reasoning model achieves **92.7% on AIME 2025** mathematical competitions while being the first reasoning model with native tool access capabilities.

Google's Gemini models uniquely offer **native image generation** through `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation` and live voice/video interactions via `gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview`. The thinking capability in Gemini 2.5 models provides transparency into reasoning processes without the token overhead of dedicated reasoning models. Their **30+ voices in 24+ languages** for audio generation surpass competitors' offerings.

Anthropic's Claude 4 models demonstrate superior performance on **long-horizon tasks requiring sustained performance** over extended periods. Their extended thinking mode in Claude 3.7 and Claude 4 provides deeper analysis capabilities. The computer use capability allows Claude to **control desktop applications via screenshots and input commands**, a unique feature among major providers.

## Rate limits vary dramatically by tier and usage

Rate limiting strategies reflect each provider's infrastructure capacity and target markets. OpenAI automatically assigns usage tiers based on payment history, with **Tier 3 ($100+ spent) required for GPT-5 and o3-mini access**. Their limits range from 200 RPM for GPT-5 models to 5,000 TPM for GPT-4o, with automatic increases based on consistent usage patterns.

Google offers the most generous rate limits, with paid tiers accessing up to **30,000 RPM and 30 million TPM** for Gemini 2.0 Flash models. Even their free tier provides reasonable access with 15 RPM and 1 million TPM for Flash models. The tier system progresses from free through three paid levels, with **Tier 3 enterprise customers receiving up to 5 billion requests per day** on certain models.

Anthropic structures limits around both request rate and token throughput, with Tier 4 customers accessing **4,000 RPM and up to 2 million input tokens per minute** for Claude Sonnet 4. Their tiering correlates with monthly spend limits, ranging from $100 at Tier 1 to $5,000 at Tier 4, providing predictable scaling for growing applications.

## API endpoints and authentication patterns

API integration patterns show both convergence and differentiation across providers. All three support **bearer token authentication** as the primary method, though implementation details vary. OpenAI uses `Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key` headers with optional organization and project identifiers. Their base URL `https://api.openai.com/v1/` follows RESTful conventions with endpoints like `/chat/completions` for the primary interface.

Google offers dual access paths through both `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/` for direct API access and Vertex AI endpoints for enterprise integration. Authentication supports both API keys (`x-goog-api-key` header) and OAuth 2.0 with appropriate scopes. Their **50% batch processing discount** requires using specific async endpoints, providing substantial savings for suitable workloads.

Anthropic maintains the simplest structure with `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` as the primary endpoint. Their API keys follow the format `sk-ant-api03-[key]` and require the `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` header for version control. Beta features activate through `anthropic-beta` headers, allowing controlled access to experimental capabilities like extended context windows.

## Conclusion

The AI API landscape in August 2025 presents mature, differentiated offerings suited to distinct use cases rather than one-size-fits-all solutions. **Organizations building coding-intensive or agentic applications should prioritize OpenAI's GPT-5 series** despite premium pricing, given its demonstrable performance advantages. **Cost-conscious deployments handling high volumes benefit most from Google's Gemini Flash variants**, especially when leveraging batch processing discounts. **Complex reasoning tasks requiring sustained performance align best with Anthropic's Claude 4 models**, particularly when prompt caching can offset higher base costs.

The universal availability of million-token contexts fundamentally changes application architectures, enabling entire knowledge bases or codebases to serve as context. The convergence on production-ready tool use and function calling across all providers means the choice increasingly depends on specific performance characteristics rather than feature availability. With all three providers offering comprehensive SDKs, extensive documentation, and enterprise-grade reliability, the decision ultimately rests on aligning model strengths with application requirements rather than platform limitations.
